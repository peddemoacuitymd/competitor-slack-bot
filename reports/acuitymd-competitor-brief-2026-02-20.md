# AcuityMD Competitor Brief — Week of February 20, 2026

---

## Top 3 Things to Know

1. **Veeva is hosting its 2026 MedTech Summit in Chicago** — a free, 40+ session event actively convening AcuityMD's top target accounts (Medtronic, BD, Philips) around Veeva's platform roadmap. This is the week's highest-urgency competitive signal. Monitor closely for any commercial/CRM announcements that encroach on AcuityMD's core territory.

2. **Definitive Healthcare reports Q4 earnings on February 26** — with revenue already down ~4% YoY and stock near 52-week lows (~$1.57), DH/Carevoyance is showing sustained business pressure. This is an active displacement opportunity for AcuityMD with medtech accounts frustrated by a non-specialized, declining platform.

3. **The rest of the competitive field was quiet this week** — Alpha Sophia, IQVIA MedTech, MedScout, and RepSignal had no meaningful new announcements. No immediate threats to respond to, but several slow-burn signals worth tracking (noted below).

## Veeva Systems (MedTech Cloud)

**Changes:**
- Published a 2025 platform release summary (via partner blog, Feb 17) highlighting new low-code automation features — specifically "Action Triggers" (IF/THEN/ELSE admin automation) and tighter SharePoint/Vault workflow integration, reducing reliance on custom SDK development
- Actively promoting the **2026 Veeva MedTech Summit, Chicago** — free admission, 40+ sessions, roadmap reveals across Quality Cloud, PromoMats, and MedComms/Link Key People
- No new press releases from Veeva directly during the Feb 13–20 window

**Competitive Implications:**
- Veeva is methodically closing its historical weakness around deployment complexity. If "hard to deploy" has been an AcuityMD sales handle against Veeva, that narrative needs sharper quantification now — cite specific time-to-value benchmarks (weeks vs. Veeva's months) before Veeva's own admins start making the counterargument
- The Summit is a mindshare risk. Veeva is locking in strategic conversations with AcuityMD's exact ICP before AcuityMD gets in the room. Track session content and any commercial/CRM roadmap reveals — any hint of procedure-level targeting or physician intelligence features would be a direct threat
- AcuityMD's strongest counter remains what Veeva cannot credibly claim: purpose-built medtech commercial intelligence, procedure-level targeting, and rep-adopted UI — reinforce these in any accounts also evaluating Veeva

## Definitive Healthcare / Carevoyance

**Changes:**
- **Q4 & Full Year 2025 earnings call scheduled February 26** — analyst consensus: $0.06 EPS, ~$59.6M revenue
- Stock at ~$1.57, near 52-week low of $1.52; down ~70%+ from 52-week highs; 78 institutional investors reduced positions last quarter vs. 47 who added
- No Carevoyance-specific product updates, feature releases, or announcements this week
- Carevoyance continues to offer free trial and Salesforce integration as standing go-to-market tactics

**Competitive Implications:**
- Four consecutive quarters of declining revenue signals customer churn and contract pressure — AcuityMD should be actively working DH/Carevoyance renewal timelines, especially at medtech accounts where the "built for medtech" gap is most acute
- Budget and R&D constraints at DH likely mean Carevoyance's product investment is slowing — AcuityMD's procedure-level intelligence and UX quality become increasingly defensible advantages vs. a potentially stagnating competitor
- The Feb 26 earnings call is worth monitoring live: listen for NRR, customer count, and any commentary on Carevoyance's roadmap or strategic priority. A weak print could open conversations with accounts questioning DH's long-term viability
- Carevoyance's free trial remains an active top-of-funnel threat with SMB/mid-market prospects — ensure AcuityMD's own trial/POC motion is sharp and fast

## Alpha Sophia

**Changes:**
- No announcements in the Feb 13–20 window; last blog activity was early January 2026
- Ongoing contextual signals: CEO + CTO attended JPMorgan Healthcare Conference in January, signaling upmarket ambitions
- Published a "vendor-agnostic" HCP targeting buyer's guide — a classic mid-funnel SEO intercept designed to capture prospects researching alternatives
- Public pricing anchored at **$14,800/year** entry point (per GetApp)
- Claims >80% US medical claims coverage

**Competitive Implications:**
- The "vendor-agnostic" buyer's guide is a direct SEO/demand-gen play targeting AcuityMD prospects mid-funnel. AcuityMD's content team should audit whether AcuityMD owns the high-intent search terms Alpha Sophia is targeting (e.g., "medtech HCP targeting platform," "physician intelligence tool")
- Alpha Sophia's $14,800/year anchor is a price-based wedge into SMB/startup accounts. AcuityMD's response isn't to compete on price — it's to make the ROI case early and tie value to outcomes (pipeline velocity, procedure-level precision, time saved) that Alpha Sophia can't credibly deliver at scale
- JPMorgan attendance signals Alpha Sophia wants to be taken seriously by enterprise buyers. Monitor whether messaging or customer references begin reflecting larger accounts

## IQVIA MedTech

**Changes:**
- CFO and incoming CFO speaking at **Citi 2026 Unplugged MedTech & Life Sciences Access Day on February 26** — live webcast available
- **10-K Annual Report filed February 17** — full-year strategic disclosures now available for review
- Sponsoring **Field Service Medical 2026** (Feb 23–25, Carlsbad CA), positioning as an outsourced field team + data partner for medtech

**Competitive Implications:**
- The dual-CFO appearance at a public investor event signals a leadership transition period — potential for near-term messaging inconsistency or strategic pause. Worth monitoring the Feb 26 webcast for any medtech commercial roadmap language
- The 10-K is worth a targeted read: look for revenue breakdowns by segment, medtech CRM (OCE) investment signals, and any language about commercial targeting or real-world evidence for devices
- IQVIA's Field Service Medical play (outsourced field teams + data) is a different GTM motion than AcuityMD's, but watch for bundled data+services deals that could crowd AcuityMD out of certain enterprise accounts. IQVIA's scale is a moat AcuityMD can't match — the counter is speed, precision, and rep adoption
